#backgammon
**College summer semester project**

**Class: Algorithmization and programming**

The player enters the initial index (the stone they are moving) and the final index (the number they rolled on the dice).
The GUI updates after playing two or four moves (when rolling the same pair).
AI, JSON save, and statistics are missing.
